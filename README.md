## ⭐ Why Star This Repo?

There are many world-model paper lists. This one makes five specific commitments that the others usually do not, and it is maintained against them.

| Commitment | What it means in practice |
| --- | --- |
| **Paradigm-first taxonomy** | Entries are organized by *what the model is* — [Generative](#1--generative-world-models), [Representational](#2--representational-world-models), or [Agentic](#3--agentic-world-models), grounded in [Mind World Models](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions) — before domain. A driving paper and a Minecraft paper that share an architecture family sit near each other conceptually; domain-first lists cannot show that. |
| **Strict inclusion heuristics** | A paper enters only when it clears the [practical boundary](#definition-and-scope): at least two of *models state*, *predicts state evolution under action or intervention*, *supports imagination, planning, evaluation, or controllable simulation*. Generic video generation, perception-only, and forecasting-only work is deliberately deprioritized — see [Deliberate non-goals](#definition-and-scope). |
| **Paper-first, primary sources, official code only** | Every entry links arXiv/venue pages, official project pages, and official repositories. Unofficial reimplementations are not badged as `GitHub` code. Blog posts are quarantined into [Selected Technical Blogs & Reports](#-selected-technical-blogs--reports) rather than mixed into the paper taxonomy. |
| **Cross-domain coverage under one definition** | Driving ([1.2](#12-autonomous-driving--generative), [2.3](#23-occupancy--bev-representations)), robotics ([1.3](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative)), games and interactive simulation ([1.1](#11-game--interactive-world-simulation)), science ([1.5](#15-scientific--physical-world-modeling)), 3D/4D worlds ([1.4](#14-3d--4d-scene-generation)), and LLM/GUI agents ([3.6](#36-llm--vlm--gui-agents-with-world-models)) are all held to the same working definition instead of being separate lists stapled together. |
| **Duplicate-aware curation** | A CI check (`scripts/check-arxiv-duplicates.mjs`) rejects any arXiv ID that appears twice unless it is explicitly allowlisted with a reason. Each paper has exactly one home; intentional cross-references use plain-text pointers like *(see §1.2.3)*. Large lists rot through silent duplication; this one cannot. |

Two smaller things that compound over time: every curation pass is **dated** (see the badge and the verification line at the top), and every entry carries a one-line, factual reason it matters — no entry is a bare link.

If that is the kind of map you want of this field, a star helps others find it.

## 🗂️ Definition and Scope

### A short working definition

A **world model** is an internal predictive model of an environment that helps an agent answer:

> **What will happen if I act, wait, intervene, or imagine an alternative future?**

That definition is intentionally broader than model-based RL, but narrower than "any model that understands the world".

### World model vs. nearby concepts

| Concept | Core question | Typical output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **world model** | what happens next under state, action, or intervention? | future observations, latent states, occupancy, trajectories, or executable rollouts |
| simulator | can the environment be replayed or executed? | environment transitions, often hand-built or learned |
| planner / policy | what should the agent do? | actions, plans, control sequences |
| perception model | what is in the scene now? | labels, detections, depth, segmentation |

### A practical boundary

A paper is strongest as a world-model entry when it does at least **two** of the following:
1. models state,
2. predicts state evolution under action or intervention,
3. supports imagination, planning, evaluation, or controllable simulation.

### Inclusion heuristics

- Prefer **primary sources**: arXiv, conference/journal pages, official project pages, and official repositories.
- Prefer papers with an explicit **dynamics / future / intervention** component over static perception-only work.
- Include adjacent work only when it materially improves the understanding of world models:
  latent planning, JEPA-style predictive representation learning, embodied evaluation, or physically grounded simulation.
- When a paper is domain-specific, place it by its **main technical role** first and by domain second.

### Deliberate non-goals

- This is **not** a generic list of video generation, VLA, or autonomous driving papers.
- Pure perception, segmentation, or forecasting papers without a genuine world-modeling role are deprioritized.
- Blog posts and secondary commentary are included selectively and are kept separate from the paper taxonomy.

## 🧭 How to Use This List

### Navigate by paradigm, then by domain

The taxonomy has one deliberate spine:

1. Decide **what kind of model** you care about. Synthesizing plausible futures → [1 · Generative](#1--generative-world-models). Learning structured internal state without pixel decoding → [2 · Representational](#2--representational-world-models). Coupling a world model to acting, planning, and evaluation → [3 · Agentic](#3--agentic-world-models). Cognitive and biological grounding → [0 · Mind World Models](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions).
2. Then narrow by **domain or mechanism** inside that paradigm (e.g. 1.2 driving, 2.2 JEPA, 3.3 closed-loop evaluation).
3. When a paper is domain-specific, it is filed by its **main technical role first** and domain second. For example, JEPLO and GLAM live under JEPA (§2.2) because they predict latent representations, with robotics domains recorded on each entry.

The [Start Here](#-start-here) table maps common intents directly to sections. The [Taxonomic Overview](#-taxonomic-overview) shows the full tree at a glance.

### What the badges mean

| Badge | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `arXiv` | The arXiv paper; the badge label carries the full arXiv ID, so you can search the page for an ID you already know. |
| `GitHub` | **Official** code or the official project repository. Unofficial reimplementations are not badged. |
| `Project` | Official project page. |
| `HuggingFace` | Official model, dataset, space, or leaderboard. |
| `Blog` | Technical blog post or official research-lab write-up. |
| `Paper` | Non-arXiv primary source: DOI, OpenReview, or proceedings page. |

### Tables vs. bullets

Two entry formats coexist by design:

- **Tables** are used where a family is mature enough to compare on fixed columns: the [RSSM / Dreamer family](#21-latent-dynamics-models-rssm--dreamer-family), [MBRL](#31-model-based-reinforcement-learning-mbrl), [Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers), [Benchmarks](#-benchmarks--evaluation), and [Community Resources](#-community-resources--open-repositories).
- **Bullets with a one-line rationale** are used in fast-moving areas where entries do not yet share a comparable schema. The indented `>` line under each bullet states, factually, why the entry is in scope.

### Finding a paper you already know

Search the rendered page for the arXiv ID. Every `arXiv` badge label carries the full ID (`2408.14837`, `2608.14530`, …), so an ID search is unambiguous even when titles or acronyms collide.

### How a curation pass works

The header date is the last **full pass**, not the last commit. A pass means: (1) new in-scope papers since the previous date were considered against [Definition and Scope](#definition-and-scope); (2) arXiv IDs and metadata were checked; (3) duplicate and badge checks were run; (4) [List Statistics](#-list-statistics) were recomputed with `node scripts/check-list-stats.mjs --update README.md`; (5) search coverage and decisions were recorded under `curation/`. Structural changes are logged in [News](#-news).

### Finding code and reproducible stacks

- Skim any section for `GitHub` badges — they always mean official code.
- For end-to-end stacks (training recipes, checkpoints, serving), go straight to [Open Toolkits & Platforms](#-community-resources--open-repositories), which collects Cosmos, minWM, Matrix-Game, Genie Envisioner, DreamerV3, TD-MPC2, V-JEPA 2, OpenDWM, and others.
- Leaderboards and datasets have their own subsections under [Community Resources](#-community-resources--open-repositories).

### What this list is not

This is **not a video-generation dump**. A video model appears only when it explicitly targets control, causality, memory, or world-model conversion — that boundary is stated at the top of [§1.6 General Video World Models & Rollout Backbones](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones) and enforced even more tightly in [§1.7 Persistent Narrative & Multi-Shot Video](#17--persistent-narrative--multi-shot-video-world-models), which requires documented state, memory, or structured planning that crosses a shot boundary. Length, resolution, visual quality, and identity consistency alone never qualify a paper. If you want a broad video-generation list, several are linked in [Curated Lists & Awesome Repos](#-community-resources--open-repositories).

### Working definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Mind World Model** | The biological and cognitive intuition that an intelligent system carries an internal model of the world and uses it for prediction, imagination, and counterfactual reasoning. |
| **Generative World Model** | Predicts or synthesizes plausible future observations, often pixels, video, occupancy, or point clouds. |
| **Representational World Model** | Predicts future *state* or *latent structure* without requiring photorealistic decoding. |
| **World Foundation Model (WFM)** | A pretrained model of environment structure and dynamics that can support simulation, planning, forecasting, or data generation across downstream tasks. |
| **JEPA** | A joint-embedding predictive architecture: predict future or missing *representations*, not pixels. The non-generative counterpoint to Section 1; see [§2.2](#22-joint-embedding-predictive-architectures-jepa). |
| **World Action Model (WAM)** | A model that jointly predicts futures *and* actions in one backbone, typically initialized from video generation. Distinct from a VLA, which maps observation + language directly to actions. See [§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam). |
| **Agentic World Model** | A WFM coupled with action selection, planning, memory, tool use, or policy optimization in a closed loop. |

## 🎓 Reading Roadmap

Three tracks. Each step names papers that are already entries in this list; follow the section link to find full citations, badges, and code.

### Track 1 — Newcomer (build the concept from zero)

Goal: understand what a world model is, where the idea comes from, and what the modern instantiations look like — roughly 7 stops.

1. **The definition.** Read [Definition and Scope](#definition-and-scope) and the working definitions under [Taxonomic Overview](#-taxonomic-overview). Ten minutes that prevent months of terminology confusion.
2. **The seminal paper.** *World Models* (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018) and its NeurIPS version *Recurrent World Models Facilitate Policy Evolution* — in [§0.1–0.2](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions). Learn V-M-C: compress perception, predict in latent space, train a controller entirely inside the dream.
3. **Latent dynamics done right.** *PlaNet* (RSSM) and *Dream to Control* (Dreamer), then skim *DreamerV2/V3* — in [§0.2](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions) and the comparison table in [§2.1](#21-latent-dynamics-models-rssm--dreamer-family). This is the reinforcement-learning lineage of the field.
4. **The generative-interactive turn.** *Genie: Generative Interactive Environments*, then the *Genie 2* and *Genie 3* lab reports — in [§1.1.2](#11-game--interactive-world-simulation). Latent actions learned from unlabeled video; playable worlds from a prompt.
5. **The non-generative counterpoint.** *V-JEPA* (and LeCun's *A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence*, [§0.1](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions)) — in [§2.2](#22-joint-embedding-predictive-architectures-jepa). Predict representations, not pixels; understand why this is an argument, not just an architecture.
6. **One driving paper.** *GAIA-1* — in [§1.2.1](#12-autonomous-driving--generative). The first large-scale autoregressive driving world model; sets up everything that follows in §1.2. (*OccWorld* in [§1.2.2](#12-autonomous-driving--generative) is the natural second read for the geometry-first side.)
7. **One robotics paper.** *UniSim: Learning Interactive Real-World Simulators* — in [§1.3.1](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative). A learned action-conditioned simulator of real-world interaction; the conceptual bridge to WAMs.

After these seven, the [Historical Timeline](#-historical-timeline) and [Architecture Cheat Sheet](#-architecture-cheat-sheet) below will read as review rather than news.

### Track 2 — Practitioner (build something this quarter)

Goal: pick a stack with open weights or code and a known deployment story. All of these have `GitHub` badges and live under [Open Toolkits & Platforms](#-community-resources--open-repositories) plus their taxonomy homes.

| Stack | What it gives you | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **NVIDIA Cosmos** (incl. Cosmos-Predict2.5, Cosmos 3) | Open world-foundation-model platform for Physical AI: pretrained video WFMs, post-training recipes, driving pipeline (Cosmos-Drive-Dreams) | [Toolkits](#-community-resources--open-repositories), [§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones) |
| **DreamerV3** | Reference latent-dynamics MBRL agent; single hyperparameter set across domains; the default baseline for imagination-based RL | [§2.1](#21-latent-dynamics-models-rssm--dreamer-family), [§3.1](#31-model-based-reinforcement-learning-mbrl) |
| **TD-MPC2** | Scalable latent MPC for continuous control (104 tasks); decoder-free, robust defaults | [§2.1](#21-latent-dynamics-models-rssm--dreamer-family), [§1.3.3](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative) |
| **V-JEPA 2** | Self-supervised video representation + action-conditioned latent planning; zero-shot manipulation recipes; official checkpoints on HuggingFace | [§2.2](#22-joint-embedding-predictive-architectures-jepa), [§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam) |
| **Matrix-Game** (1.0 → 3.0) | Open interactive game-world stack: real-time streaming rollouts, long-horizon memory in 3.0 | [§1.1.1](#11-game--interactive-world-simulation), [Toolkits](#-community-resources--open-repositories) |
| **Genie Envisioner** | Unified robotic-manipulation world platform: imagination, policy evaluation, and data generation in one loop (AgiBot) | [§1.3.1](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative), [Toolkits](#-community-resources--open-repositories) |

Supporting picks, depending on the problem: **minWM** and **Causal Forcing** for converting a video backbone into a real-time interactive world model ([§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones)); **OpenDWM** for driving; **stable-worldmodel** and **Nano World Models** for controlled research baselines (all under [Toolkits](#-community-resources--open-repositories)).

### Track 3 — Researcher (find the frontier)

1. **Surveys first.** From the [Surveys & Position Papers](#-surveys--position-papers) tables: *Understanding World or Predicting Future?* for the broad taxonomy, *Is Sora a World Simulator?* for the generative debate, *World Action Models: A Survey* and *World Action Models: The Next Frontier* for the WAM consolidation, plus the domain surveys for driving and embodied AI.
2. **Theory and safety.** The [Safety & Theory](#-surveys--position-papers) table (*When Does LeJEPA Learn a World Model?*, *General Agents Contain World Models*, *Critiques of World Models*, identifiability and value-equivalence results in [§2.1](#21-latent-dynamics-models-rssm--dreamer-family)–[§2.2](#22-joint-embedding-predictive-architectures-jepa)) and [§3.5 Safety-Aware Agentic World Models](#35-safety-aware-agentic-world-models) for the attack-surface literature.
3. **Benchmarks.** Read [Evaluation Dimensions](#-evaluation-dimensions) below as the index, then go metric-shopping in [Benchmarks & Evaluation](#-benchmarks--evaluation). Pay attention to closed-loop utility benchmarks (World-in-World, WorldGym, WorldEval) versus rollout-quality benchmarks — they disagree, and that disagreement is a research topic.
4. **Open problems.** The [Open Problems](#-open-problems) section below distills what the 2025–2026 surveys actually argue about, with entry points into the taxonomy for each.

## ⏳ Historical Timeline

Two eras, compact by design. Every named work below is an entry in this list — follow the section link for the full citation, badges, and one-line rationale.

### Cognitive and computational origins (1943–2018)

| Year | Milestone | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1943 | Craik, *The Nature of Explanation* — [§0.1](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions) | First articulation of the mind carrying a "small-scale model" of external reality used to try out alternatives before acting. |
| 1948 | Tolman, *Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men* — [§0.1](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions) | Latent spatial representations inferred from behavior; the empirical ancestor of learned internal state. |
| 1978 | O'Keefe & Nadel, *The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map* — [§0.1](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions) | Place cells as the neural substrate of Tolman's map; foundation for spatial world-model research. |
| 1983 | Johnson-Laird, *Mental Models* — [§0.1](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions) | Reasoning over constructed internal models of situations rather than formal logic. |
| 1989 | Occupancy Grids (Elfes) — [§0.1](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions) | First computational spatial world model for a physical agent; ancestor of [§2.3](#23-occupancy--bev-representations). |
| 1990 | Schmidhuber, *Making the World Differentiable* — [§0.2](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions) | Recurrent controller–model architecture cited by Ha & Schmidhuber (2018) as the direct ancestor of learned neural world models. |

## 🧩 Architecture Cheat Sheet

Eight architecture families that account for nearly every entry in this list. "State" is what the model carries between steps; "prediction target" is what it is trained to output; "failure modes" are the documented ones, not hypotheticals. Canonical papers are all entries here — follow the section links for citations and code.

| **AR transformer WM** | Discrete token history (VQ codes) with KV cache | Next visual tokens / frames | Interleaved action tokens or learned latent actions | Streaming and real-time by construction; unified with LLM tooling; latent actions learnable from unlabeled video | Tokenizer artifacts; finite context → spatial forgetting; exposure bias | Genie, Oasis, MineWorld ([§1.1.2](#11-game--interactive-world-simulation)); iVideoGPT ([§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones)); DrivingGPT ([§1.2.4](#12-autonomous-driving--generative)) |
| **RSSM / Dreamer family** | Compact deterministic + stochastic latent | Next latent state (+ reward, value; decoder optional) | Explicit action input to the transition function | Extremely cheap rollouts → sample-efficient RL in imagination; stable training recipes | Limited visual capacity; mostly proven at simulator scale; latent hallucination outside the data manifold | PlaNet, Dreamer, DreamerV2/V3 ([§2.1](#21-latent-dynamics-models-rssm--dreamer-family)); DreamerV4 ([§3.1](#31-model-based-reinforcement-learning-mbrl)); TD-MPC2 (decoder-free relative, [§2.1](#21-latent-dynamics-models-rssm--dreamer-family)) |

| **Occupancy / BEV WM** | Explicit 3D voxel occupancy or BEV grid | Future occupancy / BEV frames | Ego trajectory, agent commands, language (OccLLaMA) | Metric geometry; direct planner interface; sensor-fusion friendly | Resolution–memory trade-off; appearance-free (needs a renderer for photorealism); semantic sparsity | OccWorld, Drive-OccWorld, DOME ([§1.2.2](#12-autonomous-driving--generative)); OccSora, BEVWorld ([§2.3](#23-occupancy--bev-representations)) |
| **3DGS / NeRF worlds** | Explicit persistent 3D scene (Gaussians, fields, meshes) | Novel-view renders + scene evolution | Camera trajectory; object-level edits; physics add-ons | 3D consistency by construction; revisitable, editable, engine-loadable worlds | Dynamics usually bolted on; costly scene construction; closed-world assumption | EmerNeRF, 4D Gaussian Splatting, HunyuanWorld 1.0, LayerPano3D ([§1.4.1](#14-3d--4d-scene-generation)); GWM, GaussianWorld ([§1.3.1](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative), [§1.2.2](#12-autonomous-driving--generative)) |
| **LLM text WM** | Textual / symbolic state description | Next state description, transition validity, or executable program | Text actions; tool calls | Abstract and counterfactual reasoning; composable with agent frameworks; cheap | State drift and hallucination over steps; weak physical/spatial grounding; hard to verify | LLM-Sim ([§2.4](#24-multimodal-text-acoustic--memory-oriented-world-models)); RAP, WebDreamer, CWM ([§3.6](#36-llm--vlm--gui-agents-with-world-models)); Text2World, PoE-World ([§2.5](#25-symbolic--knowledge-graph-world-models)) |

Reading the table: the top half trades **fidelity against control** (diffusion vs. AR), the middle trades **capacity against efficiency** (RSSM/JEPA vs. pixel models), and the bottom half trades **structure against openness** (occupancy/3D worlds vs. text vs. joint video-action). Most 2026 systems are hybrids that pick one row as a backbone and borrow mechanisms from two others.

### 1.7 🎬 Persistent Narrative & Multi-Shot Video World Models

> Every video generator implicitly models visual dynamics, but implicit dynamics alone are below the bar here. An entry needs documented state, memory, or structured planning that crosses a chunk/shot/scene boundary, plus continued prediction from that state, intervention on the ongoing rollout, or evaluation of its downstream use. Streaming has a higher interactivity ceiling only when the system accepts new input after a generated prefix is already available; autoregression, generation speed, identity consistency, or full-sequence attention alone does not suffice — nor does video length, visual quality, or multi-shot output. Methods whose primary contribution is generic causal/streaming rollout machinery live in §1.6; entries that overlap both are placed by primary contribution.

## 🚧 Open Problems

Twelve questions the 2025–2026 surveys and position papers in this list actually argue about — not a wish list. Each problem names its entry points here.

1. **Compounding error over long horizons.** Autoregressive rollouts drift off-manifold; every mitigation (self-forcing, history guidance, rolling windows, distillation) trades something else away. When is drift a training-objective artifact versus a fundamental limit of learned single-step dynamics? Entry points: the forcing-family recipes and long-context models in [§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones); *Orbis* ([§1.2.1](#12-autonomous-driving--generative)).
2. **Action controllability and grounding.** Video backbones absorb actions as weak conditioning and often ignore them; latent actions learned from unlabeled video may not align with executable controls. How do we guarantee — and measure — that actions cause futures? Entry points: ACT-Bench, VRAG Benchmark ([Benchmarks](#-benchmarks--evaluation)); Genie's latent actions ([§1.1.2](#11-game--interactive-world-simulation)); AdaWorld, WALA ([§1.3.1](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative), [§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam)).
3. **Physical grounding vs. photorealism.** Scaling improves appearance faster than physics; models interpolate visual statistics rather than learning laws. Does physical competence require explicit structure (Hamiltonian latents, differentiable simulators, occupancy) or only better data and probes? Entry points: *PhyWorld*, *Physically Native World Models*, *PhysCoRe* ([§1.5.1](#15-scientific--physical-world-modeling), [§1.3.1](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative)); *Physical Grounding in World Models* ([Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers)).
4. **Memory and persistent state.** Pixel-history context is not a world state: off-screen content decays, revisits contradict earlier generations. Explicit 3D state, retrieval, and hierarchical memory all help and all cost; none is settled. Entry points: [§1.1.3](#11-game--interactive-world-simulation) as a whole; *Beyond Pixel Histories* ([§1.4.2](#14-3d--4d-scene-generation)); *On Memory* ([§2.4](#24-multimodal-text-acoustic--memory-oriented-world-models)); MBench, STEVO-Bench ([Benchmarks](#-benchmarks--evaluation)).
5. **Evaluation itself.** Benchmarks have multiplied faster than agreement on what they measure; rollout-quality metrics and closed-loop utility rank models differently, and most metrics need ground-truth futures that interventions destroy. Entry points: [Evaluation Dimensions](#-evaluation-dimensions); *Validate the Dream*, *Reference-Free Physical Consistency* ([§3.3](#33-closed-loop-simulation--evaluation)); World-in-World ([Benchmarks](#-benchmarks--evaluation)).
6. **Safety, robustness, and the trusted-imagination attack surface.** Imagined futures now gate real actions, which makes the world model itself a target: adversarial contexts, data poisoning that only manifests downstream, and optimistic rollouts that hide failures. Entry points: BadWorld, *World-Model Supply-Chain Poisoning*, *Trusted Imagination Attacks*, *World Models in Pieces* ([§3.5](#35-safety-aware-agentic-world-models)); RoboTrustBench ([Benchmarks](#-benchmarks--evaluation)).
7. **Data: action labels are the bottleneck.** Internet video is abundant but action-free; robot data is labeled but tiny and embodiment-specific. Latent actions, inverse dynamics, human-video transfer, and synthetic data engines each cover part of the gap. Entry points: WALA, EgoWAM, LaST-HD ([§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam)); DreamDojo, PlayWorld ([§1.3.1](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative)); *Geographic Diversity for JEPA Driving WMs* ([§1.2.4](#12-autonomous-driving--generative)).
8. **Sim-to-real and real-to-sim closure.** When can a policy trained or validated inside a learned world model be trusted on hardware — and can real recordings be lifted into simulation-ready twins automatically? Entry points: [§1.3.5](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative); *Efficient Sim-to-Real WAM* ([§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam)); RWM-U, *Robotic World Model* ([§1.3.3](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative)); *Quadrotor WM Generalization* ([§1.3.2](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative)).
9. **Multi-agent shared worlds.** Almost everything in this list models one agent's view; shared, jointly consistent worlds with other goal-directed agents (traffic, multiplayer, social dynamics) are barely started. Entry points: [§3.4](#34-multi-agent-world-models); Solaris, *Multiplayer Interactive World Models* ([§1.1.2](#11-game--interactive-world-simulation)); SceneDiffuser++ ([§1.2.4](#12-autonomous-driving--generative)).
10. **Are video generators world models?** The Sora debate, still unresolved: implicit dynamics demonstrably emerge, and demonstrably violate physical law out of distribution. The productive version of the question is *what additional structure converts one into the other*. Entry points: *Is Sora a World Simulator?*, *Mechanistic View on Video Generation as WMs*, *Critiques of World Models* ([Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers)); the §1.6/§1.7 boundary notes ([§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones), [§1.7](#17--persistent-narrative--multi-shot-video-world-models)).
11. **Reconstruction vs. representation.** Should the model predict pixels at all? Decoder-free (JEPA, TD-MPC2) and decoder-optional designs are cheaper and sometimes plan better, but are harder to inspect and evaluate. Entry points: *Reconstruction or Semantics?* ([Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers)); *ImageWAM*, *Fast-WAM* ([§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam)); [§2.2](#22-joint-embedding-predictive-architectures-jepa) theory entries.
12. **Real-time inference economics.** Interactive world models must generate under strict latency budgets; distillation, delta tokens, keyframe sparsity, and flash-style serving all exist because full-fidelity imagination is currently too slow to act on. Entry points: *A Frame is Worth One Token* ([§1.1.1](#11-game--interactive-world-simulation)); SKIP, LaWAM ([§1.3.1](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative), [§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam)); minWM, MoWorld, FlashDreams ([§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones), [Toolkits](#-community-resources--open-repositories)).

## 🧪 Evaluation Dimensions

"Evaluating a world model" means at least eleven different things, and a single leaderboard number conflates them. This section is the conceptual index into [Benchmarks & Evaluation](#-benchmarks--evaluation); every benchmark named below is an entry in that table or in [§3.3](#33-closed-loop-simulation--evaluation).

| Dimension | Question it answers | Typical measurements | Where to look in this list |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Visual fidelity** | Do rollouts look like real observations? | FVD/FID-style distances, human preference, per-frame quality | WorldModelBench, DrivingGen, EWMBench, WorldSimBench |
| **2. Action controllability** | Do different actions produce correctly different futures? | Action-following accuracy, instruction adherence, trajectory-conditioned error | ACT-Bench, VRAG Benchmark, MiraBench, iWorld-Bench, MIND (control axis) |
| **3. 3D / geometric consistency** | Is the implied 3D world stable across viewpoints and revisits? | Reprojection/loop-closure error, multi-view consistency, camera-controlled probing | ViewBench, WRBench, 4DWorldBench, WorldScore, PDI-Bench, RoboPhys-3D, Toward Memory-Aided World Models (LoopNav) |
| **4. Physical plausibility** | Does the rollout obey mechanics, permanence, and conservation? | Physics-law probes, intuitive-physics batteries, commonsense violation rates | Physics-IQ Verified, VideoPhy-2, WorldBench, PhysWeep, PhysicsMind, Tailor-Bench, WorldOlympiad |
| **5. Long-horizon memory** | Does content that left the view come back correct? | Revisit consistency, occlusion probes, minute-scale drift metrics | MBench, MIND, STEVO-Bench, R2M-Bench, GUI-CC, Toward Stable World Models, Omni-WorldBench |
| **6. Closed-loop policy utility** | Does the model actually help an agent act? | Real-task success of policies trained/evaluated inside the model; sim-vs-real ranking agreement | World-in-World, WorldGym, WorldEval, PiL-World, GigaWorld-1 / WMBench, ReactSim-Bench, RoboWM-Bench ([§3.3](#33-closed-loop-simulation--evaluation)) |
| **7. Sample efficiency** | How little real experience does model-based learning need? | Score at fixed interaction budget | Atari 100k, DMControl Suite, ProcGen, Minecraft Diamond (DreamerV3) |
| **8. Safety & robustness** | Does the model resist perturbations, misuse, and optimistic bias? | Adversarial-context degradation, unsafe-instruction rejection, poisoning detection, optimism-bias probes | RoboTrustBench, ARB4WM, MiraBench (optimism bias), MMBench2 (hallucination), plus the attack literature in [§3.5](#35-safety-aware-agentic-world-models) |
| **9. Counterfactual fidelity** | Do intervention-edited rollouts diverge the way the world would? | Intervention/counterfactual probe accuracy, causal-consistency scoring | What-If World, RoboTrustBench (counterfactual axis), WM-ABench (atomic internal-model probes) |
| **10. Distributional calibration** | Do repeated futures reproduce the range and probabilities of possible outcomes? | Outcome-frequency calibration and distribution coverage under fixed initial state and action | PAWBench |
| **11. Decision validity** | Does a model rank actions and justify additional planning or adaptation compute? | Fixed-candidate action ranking, matched intervention effects, update-versus-hold utility, total compute cost | ARC-Bench; Intervention Gap ([Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers)); Counterfactual Update Utility and Compute-Value Audit ([§3.3](#33-closed-loop-simulation--evaluation)) |

Three cautions, all documented in entries here:

- **Dimensions 1 and 4 dissociate.** High visual fidelity with broken physics is the normal failure mode, not the exception (*PhyWorld*, [§1.5.1](#15-scientific--physical-world-modeling)).
- **Dimensions 1–5 do not predict dimension 6.** Rollout-quality metrics and policy-utility outcomes can rank models differently; this is why [§3.3](#33-closed-loop-simulation--evaluation) exists as its own subsection, and why *Validate the Dream* argues for admissibility checks before trusting simulator verdicts.
- **Reference-free evaluation is still open.** Most metrics need ground-truth futures that interventions make unavailable; see *Reference-Free Physical Consistency* in [§3.3](#33-closed-loop-simulation--evaluation).

## 📘 Glossary

Precise working definitions, in the sense used throughout this list. Alphabetical. Terms in *italics* are cross-references within the glossary.

- **Action-conditioned rollout** — Generating a future trajectory (frames, latents, occupancy) where each step is conditioned on a supplied action, so different action sequences must produce different futures. The minimum bar separating a world model from a video generator; benchmarked by ACT-Bench and the VRAG Benchmark ([Benchmarks](#-benchmarks--evaluation)).
- **Agentic world model** — A *world foundation model* coupled with action selection, planning, memory, tool use, or policy optimization in a closed loop. The organizing idea of [Section 3](#3--agentic-world-models).
- **BEV (bird's-eye view)** — A top-down metric grid representation of a scene, standard in driving. BEV world models predict future BEV frames; see [§2.3](#23-occupancy--bev-representations).
- **Causal forcing** — A training/distillation recipe that converts bidirectional video diffusion into causal (past-only) autoregressive generation suitable for real-time interaction; named after the Causal Forcing line of work in [§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones).
- **Closed-loop vs. open-loop** — Open-loop: the model predicts a future once, from a fixed prompt/context, and is scored against ground truth. Closed-loop: the model's outputs feed back into its own inputs (or a policy acts inside it) over many steps, so errors can compound and interventions matter. Closed-loop evaluation is the stricter and more decision-relevant regime; see [§3.3](#33-closed-loop-simulation--evaluation).
- **Compounding error (rollout drift)** — Accumulation of small per-step prediction errors during autoregressive rollout, driving generated futures off the data manifold. The central engineering obstacle of §1.6; mitigations include *self-forcing*, history guidance, memory modules, and 3D anchoring.
- **Counterfactual** — A "what would have happened if" query: same initial state, different action or intervention. A world model with counterfactual fidelity produces futures that diverge correctly under such edits; benchmarked by What-If World and parts of RoboTrustBench ([Benchmarks](#-benchmarks--evaluation)).
- **Diffusion forcing** — A training objective mixing next-token-style causal prediction with full-sequence diffusion, giving per-frame noise levels; a backbone recipe for controllable causal video rollouts ([§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones)).
- **Digital twin vs. world model** — A digital twin is an instance-specific, engineered replica of one particular asset or site, kept synchronized with it. A world model is a *learned, generalizing* predictive model of environment dynamics. Twins can be built *from* world models (see Real2Sim, [§1.3.5](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative)) and world models can be trained from twins, but the terms are not interchangeable; see the *Digital Twin AI* survey ([Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers)).
- **Dyna-style rollout** — Using a learned model to generate imagined transitions that augment real experience for policy learning (after Sutton's Dyna architecture). MBPO in [§3.1](#31-model-based-reinforcement-learning-mbrl) is the canonical deep-RL instantiation.
- **Energy-based JEPA** — LeCun's formulation in which a predictor is trained to make representations of compatible (context, target) pairs low-energy, without reconstructing pixels — avoiding wasted capacity on unpredictable detail. The theoretical program behind [§2.2](#22-joint-embedding-predictive-architectures-jepa).
- **Generative world model** — Predicts or synthesizes plausible future *observations* (pixels, video, occupancy, point clouds), typically usable as a learned simulator or data engine. [Section 1](#1--generative-world-models).
- **Imagination** — Rolling the world model forward without touching the real environment, to train a policy (Dreamer), plan (MPC/MCTS), evaluate a policy, or synthesize data. "Training in imagination" means the policy never sees real transitions during optimization.
- **Inverse dynamics model (IDM)** — A model that infers the action connecting two observed states. Used to label action-free video, to ground *latent actions*, and to turn generated videos into executable robot commands ([§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam)).
- **Latent action** — An action representation learned from unlabeled video rather than recorded controls (Genie, AdaWorld). Enables interactive control of models trained on internet-scale data without action labels; must be mapped to executable controls for robotics.
- **Latent dynamics model** — A world model whose transition function operates on a compact learned state rather than observations; the RSSM/Dreamer family in [§2.1](#21-latent-dynamics-models-rssm--dreamer-family) is the reference implementation.
- **Long-horizon memory** — Mechanisms (explicit 3D state, retrieval, surfel/keyframe caches, state-space models) that keep a rollout consistent with content generated many steps ago, including content that left the field of view. See [§1.1.3](#11-game--interactive-world-simulation) and the memory benchmarks MBench, MIND, and STEVO-Bench ([Benchmarks](#-benchmarks--evaluation)).
- **MBRL (model-based reinforcement learning)** — RL that learns and exploits a dynamics model for sample efficiency, via imagined training, planning, or both. [§3.1](#31-model-based-reinforcement-learning-mbrl).
- **MPC (model-predictive control)** — At each step, optimize a short action sequence against the world model's predicted futures, execute the first action, re-plan. The standard way to use latent world models for control without a learned policy (PlaNet, TD-MPC2).
- **Neural simulator** — A learned model used *in place of* a hand-built simulator: action-in, observation-out, at interactive rates, with enough fidelity to train or evaluate policies (UniSim, RoboWorld, NVIDIA OmniDreams). The claim is functional, not architectural.
- **Occupancy (grid)** — A voxelized representation marking which regions of 3D space are occupied (optionally with semantics). The oldest world-model formalization in this list (Elfes 1989, [§0.1](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions)) and a mainline of driving world models ([§1.2.2](#12-autonomous-driving--generative), [§2.3](#23-occupancy--bev-representations)).
- **Open-loop evaluation** — See *closed-loop vs. open-loop*.
- **Physical plausibility vs. photorealism** — Orthogonal axes: a rollout can look real while violating conservation laws, object permanence, or contact dynamics. PhyWorld, Physics-IQ Verified, and VideoPhy-2 ([Benchmarks](#-benchmarks--evaluation)) measure the physics axis specifically.
- **Policy-in-the-loop evaluation** — Scoring a world model by how well a policy trained or evaluated *inside* it transfers to the real environment — the utility-centric alternative to visual metrics. WorldGym, WorldEval, PiL-World, World-in-World ([§3.3](#33-closed-loop-simulation--evaluation), [Benchmarks](#-benchmarks--evaluation)).
- **Predictive coding** — Hierarchical inference in which higher areas predict lower-level activity and only prediction errors are propagated (Rao & Ballard 1999; Friston's free-energy generalization). The neuroscientific ancestor of JEPA-style representation prediction ([§0.1](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions), [§2.2](#22-joint-embedding-predictive-architectures-jepa)).
- **Real2Sim / Sim-to-Real** — Real2Sim: constructing simulation-ready scene twins from real recordings ([§1.3.5](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative)). Sim-to-Real: transferring a policy or model trained in simulation (or imagination) to the physical world. World models sit on both bridges.
- **Representational world model** — Predicts future *state or latent structure* without requiring photorealistic decoding. [Section 2](#2--representational-world-models).
- **RSSM (recurrent state-space model)** — The PlaNet/Dreamer transition architecture: a deterministic recurrent path plus a stochastic latent path, trained with variational objectives; supports fast latent-space planning and imagination.
- **Self-forcing** — Training an autoregressive video model on its *own* generated prefixes rather than ground-truth frames, closing the train–test gap that causes rollout drift. Contrast *teacher forcing*; see [§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones).
- **Streaming / real-time interactivity** — The system accepts new user input *after* a generated prefix already exists and continues from it at interactive latency. Stricter than autoregression or generation speed alone — this is the §1.7 bar for "interactive".
- **Successor representation / successor features** — A predictive state encoding of expected future occupancy (Dayan 1993), generalized to deep features by Barreto et al. (2017). Dynamics are represented independently of the reward, which is why they sit with representational world models ([§0.1](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions), [§0.2](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions)).
- **Teacher forcing** — Training a sequence model with ground-truth history as input at every step. Efficient, but the model never learns to recover from its own mistakes — the root cause of exposure bias in rollouts.
- **VLA vs. WAM** — A VLA (vision-language-action model) maps observations and language *directly* to actions; any world knowledge is implicit. A WAM (world action model) explicitly couples future prediction and action generation — it can imagine, then act, or co-generate both. The boundary cases (VLAs with latent world-model regularizers) live in [§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam); see also *Do World Action Models Generalize Better than VLAs?* ([Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers)).
- **Value equivalence** — A world model is value-equivalent to the environment if it yields the same values (and therefore the same policy) even when it is inaccurate as an observation predictor (Grimm et al., [§0.2](#0--mind-world-models--biological-origins--foundational-definitions)). The theoretical justification for MuZero-style abstract models and for decoder-free latent dynamics.
- **WAM (world action model)** — A model that jointly learns environment dynamics and action generation in one backbone, typically initialized from video generation. The fastest-growing family in this list ([§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam)).
- **WFM (world foundation model)** — A pretrained model of environment structure and dynamics reusable across downstream tasks (simulation, planning, forecasting, data generation) — e.g. Cosmos, Genie, V-JEPA 2. "Foundation" refers to pretraining breadth, not architecture.
- **World model** — An internal predictive model of an environment that helps an agent answer: *what will happen if I act, wait, intervene, or imagine an alternative future?* Intentionally broader than model-based RL and narrower than "any model that understands the world" — see [Definition and Scope](#definition-and-scope).

## ❓ FAQ

**Q1. Is Sora a world model?**
Unresolved, and this list treats it that way. OpenAI's 2024 report frames video generation models as world simulators ([Blogs](#-selected-technical-blogs--reports)); the survey *Is Sora a World Simulator?* and the physical-law study *PhyWorld* ([Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers), [§1.5.1](#15-scientific--physical-world-modeling)) document both the emergent dynamics and the systematic violations. Operationally: a video generator qualifies for the taxonomy here only when it demonstrates action conditioning, state persistence, or evaluable world-model use — the boundary stated at the top of [§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones).

**Q2. What is the difference between a VLA, a world model, and a WAM?**
A VLA maps observation + language directly to actions; a world model predicts what happens next under actions or interventions; a WAM does both in one backbone — it jointly predicts futures and actions. See the *VLA vs. WAM* glossary entry, [§1.3.4](#134-world-model-based-vision-language-action-vla--world-action-models-wam), and the empirical comparison *Do World Action Models Generalize Better than VLAs?* ([Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers)).

**Q3. Why are generic video-generation papers excluded?**
Because implicit visual dynamics alone are below the bar. An entry needs at least two of: models state; predicts state evolution under action/intervention; supports imagination, planning, evaluation, or controllable simulation ([Definition and Scope](#definition-and-scope)). Video length, resolution, identity consistency, and multi-shot output do not qualify by themselves — [§1.7](#17--persistent-narrative--multi-shot-video-world-models) spells this out for the hardest boundary cases.

**Q4. How are duplicates handled?**
Every paper has exactly one home section, chosen by main technical role. Intentional cross-references are plain-text pointers like *(see §1.2.3)*, not repeated links. CI runs `node scripts/check-arxiv-duplicates.mjs README.md`, which fails on any arXiv ID appearing twice unless it is allowlisted in `.github/arxiv-duplicate-allowlist.json` with a reason.

**Q5. How do I add a paper?**
For a lightweight suggestion, open a paper-suggestion issue. For a curated addition, open a PR following [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): use the existing entry format, link primary sources, place it in the most appropriate section, keep the one-line description factual, and run the lint commands in the checklist. Taxonomy changes need their own justification (which entries move, and why the current tree fails them).

**Q6. A paper fits both Generative and Representational — where does it go?**
By its **main technical contribution**, not its outputs. A model that predicts latents and *optionally* decodes pixels is representational; a model whose contribution is the synthesized observation stream is generative; a model wrapped in planning/acting machinery is agentic. Domain placement comes second — see the routing rule in [Definition and Scope](#definition-and-scope).

**Q7. Is my perception / segmentation / trajectory-forecasting paper in scope?**
Usually not on its own. Pure perception answers "what is in the scene now", not "what happens if". It enters when it carries a genuine world-modeling role — e.g. occupancy *forecasting* under ego action ([§1.2.2](#12-autonomous-driving--generative)) rather than occupancy estimation.

**Q8. Is a physics simulator or a digital twin a world model?**
Not by default. Hand-built simulators execute engineered dynamics; digital twins mirror one specific asset. This list includes them when they are *learned*, when they are constructed automatically from observation (Real2Sim, [§1.3.5](#13-embodied-ai--robotics--generative)), or when a learned model plays the simulator's role (neural simulators — see the Glossary). The *Digital Twin AI* survey ([Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers)) covers the relationship.

**Q9. What exactly is a "World Foundation Model"?**
A pretrained model of environment structure and dynamics that supports multiple downstream uses — simulation, planning, forecasting, data generation — as defined in the [working definitions](#-taxonomic-overview). Cosmos, Genie, and V-JEPA 2 are the canonical examples here. It is a claim about pretraining breadth and reusability, not about any particular architecture.

**Q10. Why is a famous paper missing?**
Three common reasons: it is out of scope under the two-of-three boundary (most video generation and most VLAs); it is a secondary source (commentary, re-implementations, news); or it genuinely slipped through — in which case, see Q5. Absence is a scope judgment before it is an omission.

**Q11. What do the `GitHub` badges guarantee?**
Official code or the official project repository only. Unofficial reimplementations are deliberately not badged, per [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). If an official repo appears later, PRs updating the badge are welcome.

**Q12. How often is the list updated, and what does a "curation pass" mean?**
The header states the date of the last curation pass. The [September 15, 2026 audit](curation/2026-09-15.md) records reference-list comparisons, arXiv metadata checks, new-paper screening, exclusions, and validation results. External project and code links are checked where added or corrected; this is not a claim that every older external URL was retested. The [News](#-news) section records structural changes. Counts in [List Statistics](#-list-statistics) are recomputed on each pass from the rules in that section's comment.

**Q13. Why are some famous video generators (Sora, FramePack, MAGI-1, …) not listed as papers?**
They fail the two-of-three inclusion boundary in [Definition and Scope](#definition-and-scope), or they are secondary reports already covered by the Sora debate in [FAQ Q1](#-faq) and [Surveys](#-surveys--position-papers). Length, resolution, identity consistency, and multi-shot output alone never qualify a paper; [§1.6](#16-general-video-world-models--rollout-backbones) and [§1.7](#17--persistent-narrative--multi-shot-video-world-models) state the extra bar for video backbones.

**Q14. A paper appears under a different name than I searched for. How do I find it?**
Search the page for the arXiv ID (the `arXiv` badge label carries the full ID). If the paper is filed under a later version or a sibling name, the one-line rationale usually mentions the connection (e.g. AlayaWorld v1.1 is noted on the existing AlayaWorld entry rather than duplicated).

## 📊 List Statistics

<!-- Maintained by node scripts/check-list-stats.mjs --update README.md.
     Counting rules — keep these stable so numbers are comparable across passes:
     - unique arXiv papers:   count of distinct arXiv IDs, exactly as computed by
                              `node scripts/check-arxiv-duplicates.mjs README.md` (it prints "N unique IDs").
                              Includes abs/pdf/html links, legacy IDs, and normalized versions.
     - total entries:         count of taxonomy bullets and table rows that name a work, i.e. lines matching
                              `^- \*\*` ONLY within sections 0–3, plus paper rows in the §2.1, §3.1, Surveys, and Benchmarks tables.
                              Excludes News, explanatory bullets, glossary entries, blogs, and resource tables.
     - official-code links:   rg -c 'img.shields.io/badge/GitHub' README.md   (badge occurrences; official code only, per badge policy)
     - project pages:         rg -c 'img.shields.io/badge/Project' README.md
     - taxonomy sections:     numbered `##`/`###`/`####` headings inside sections 0–3 (subsections included).
     - benchmarks:            rows in the Benchmarks & Evaluation table.
     - surveys:               rows across the four Surveys & Position Papers tables.
     - last verified:         date of the latest full curation pass (must match the header line).
